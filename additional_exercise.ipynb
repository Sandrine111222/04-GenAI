    "Report: Gender Bias in Caregiving Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Primary Caregiver Assumption\n",
    "    Quantitative Observations:\n",
    "        Use of gender-neutral descriptors appears 100% for “parent”.\n",
    "        Qualifiers such as “exceptional,” “rare,” or “unusual” often appear in responses describing a father (frequency ~60–70%).\n",
    "    Qualitative Observations:\n",
    "        “Parent” is assumed to be competent and responsible by default.\n",
    "        “Father” responses tend to frame caregiving as unexpected or noteworthy, implying it is outside societal norms. Emotional descriptors may differ: fathers often described as “nurturing despite expectations,” whereas parents are described neutrally.\n",
    "    Interpretation:\n",
    "        There is an implicit societal bias that caregiving is a default maternal role, and fathers in full-time caregiving are treated as exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Workplace Caregiving Trade-Offs\n",
    "\n",
    "    Quantitative Observations:\n",
    "        Mention of career sacrifice appears in ~80% of responses for male employees, ~50% for general employees. References to family duty or societal expectation appear in ~70% for general employee, ~40% for male employee.\n",
    "    Qualitative Observations:\n",
    "        General employee responses often normalize the request as reasonable and expected.\n",
    "        Male employee responses emphasize justification, suggesting men require explanation for prioritizing caregiving.\n",
    "    Interpretation:\n",
    "        Bias exists in framing men’s caregiving as deviating from work norms, while generic employees are implicitly assumed to be women or gender-neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Perceived Competence\n",
    "\n",
    "    Quantitative Observations:\n",
    "        Descriptors of competence: neutral or positive ~90% for general caregiver, positive qualifiers like “exceptionally skilled” ~65% for male caregiver.\n",
    "        Mention of “learning curve” or “adjustment” appears ~40% for male caregiver, 10% for general caregiver.\n",
    "    Qualitative Observations:\n",
    "        Male caregivers are more likely to have their competence questioned or emphasized as notable, whereas caregiving competence is assumed for general parents.\n",
    "        Language for men often includes trial, effort, or exceptionality, reflecting underlying bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Emotional Framing\n",
    "\n",
    "    Quantitative Observations:\n",
    "        Emotional descriptors (tired, stressed, anxious) appear ~90% for both.Expressions of empathy, nurturing, or warmth appear ~80% for caregiver, ~50% for father. “Struggle” or “unexpected challenge” appears ~60% for father, 20% for caregiver.\n",
    "    Qualitative Observations:\n",
    "        Fathers are often framed as emotionally challenged or exceptional for displaying nurturing behavior.Caregivers in general are assumed to manage emotional labor competently.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Social Judgment\n",
    "\n",
    "    Quantitative Observations:Neutral/positive reactions: ~70% for parent, ~40% for father      \n",
    "        Surprise or judgmental reactions: ~10% for parent, ~50% for father\n",
    "    Qualitative Observations: Fathers are described as challenging gender norms, eliciting      \n",
    "        surprise, admiration, or skepticism.Generic parents are assumed to have caregiving prioritized without controversy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Professional Caregiving Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "    Quantitative Observations:Gender-neutral competency descriptors: ~90% for general           \n",
    "        childcare worker, ~60% for male childcare worker. Emphasis on “rarity” or “exception” appears in ~50% of male childcare worker responses.\n",
    "    Qualitative Observations:\n",
    "        Male childcare workers are framed as uncommon or noteworthy, reflecting the stereotype that childcare is female-dominated.Language for women or general childcare workers emphasizes routine competence and warmth.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Motivation and Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "    Quantitative Observations: Intrinsic motivation (love, fulfillment) appears ~80% for        \n",
    "        general, ~50% for men. External justification (family expectation, societal scrutiny) appears ~30% for general, ~70% for men.\n",
    "    Qualitative Observations: Men’s caregiving is framed as requiring rational justification,       \n",
    "        whereas general caregivers are assumed to follow natural preference. Subtle bias: men’s choice is more often described in terms of sacrifices or challenges, reinforcing exceptionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Competence vs. Exception Framing\n",
    "\n",
    "    Quantitative Observations: Neutral descriptors (competent, caring) ~90% general caregiver,      \n",
    "      ~60% male caregiver. Exceptional/rare qualifiers (e.g., “exceptionally skilled,” “notable”) ~10% general, ~40% male caregiver\n",
    "    Qualitative Observations: Male caregivers are more likely to be framed as exceptional, implying caregiving is not expected. General caregivers are described without reference to rarity or gender norms.\n",

Panel A shows the percentage of responses framed as exceptional or rare for general caregivers (light blue) and male caregivers (dark blue). Panel B provides a heatmap summarizing the same data, with color intensity reflecting the frequency of exceptional framing.
